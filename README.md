# Data Analysis Report
## Analysis Background
Customers of a company (dbo.Users) receive various offers (dbo.Offers). The company is interested in measuring the activity (dbo.Activity) resulting from communications (dbo.Comms) of these offers.

## Question 1: the average revenue for users by day of the week

**Graph 1. The average renvenue for users by day of the week**

*Key findings*: 
1. This graph shows the variation of the average renvenue by day of the week. It is evident that from Y2016Q3 to Y2016Q4, the average revenue increased through all the days of the week. However, the revenue decliened a little bit after 2016.
2. Compared with other days of week, Tuesday shows averagely higher revenue.

*Further improvements*
1. Why the renvenue declined after 2016? What are the factors? Maybe less users responded to the offers after 2016 and this can be analysed with the offers data.
2. Why the renvenue in Tuesday is higher? More analysis can be done. For example, people in some countries have more holidays on Tuesday.

## Question 2: the distribution of revenue generated by user age

**Graph 2. The distribution of average revenue generated per user and the number of users**

*Key findings*: 
1. It is very interesting that we can see that the age group '45-64' is smaller than '25-44' but the average renvenue per user (ARPU). Therefore, the age group '45-64' has a larger wallet.
2. Compared with the age group '65 and over', '25-44' group is the major contributor to the renvenue because it has large number of users and relative high ARPU.
3. The age group 'Up to 24' has the smallest people and the ARPU is the smallest as well. Therefore, it is not a good idea to set them as the target audience and we should spend less marketing on them.

*Further improvements*
1. In order to provide better service to key users aged from 25 to 64, it will be helpful to marketing when we analyse the users data like location.


## Question 3: the number of revenue-generating users by year-month

</p>

**Graph 3. The number of renvenue-generating users by year-month**

*Key findings*: 
1. This graph can aid the analysis in the first graph, the renvenue increased from the the third quarter of 2016 and decreased from the beginning of 2017. The variation of the number of renvenue-generating users also have similar trend. Therefore, the loss of users might be a reason for the decrease since 2017.

*Further improvements*
1. More analysis should be made with the user profiles like locations to find out why they generated less renvenue. In addition, it is also worth to analysing the data with offers. Less discount could also result in a decrease in the number of users.

## Question 4: the response rate of each offer

</p>

**Graph 4. The response rate of each offer**

*Key findings*: 
1. The response rate are relatively small and around 2.3%. The biggest difference between the offers is around 0.6% between Offer 4 and Offer 8.

*Further improvements*
1. Due to the limitations of the offers data, there is no details about the offers. Further analysis can be conducted with the context of the offer and the discount provided.

## General limitations and improvements
1. **Further improvements**
As discussed above, we can see some trends from the graphs but the reasons behind that are still unconvered. More data and analysis are needed to discover the root reasons.
2. **Data analysis process**
Normally, in a data analysis process, data integrity and cleaning should be the first thing to do. However, in this task, due to the time limitation, I didn't perform data check in the SQL server like null values and negative values. This could be a risk of the analysis quality.
3. **Improvements in SQL query**
For some questions like question 4, it requires cross-table and nested query which results in a large reponse time. Further improvements should be performed to increase the speed and efficiency.
4. **Development of Power Bi**
Compared with Python, Power Bi is easier to use. It can provide a lot built-in functions and the dashboard enhance the reusability of data. I would recommand to use it to tell the data story and monitor the indicators like reponse time and ARPU.
5. **Graphs**
Due to the time limitations, I only finished the fundmental elements of the graphs. More visuals should be used to increase the readability.
